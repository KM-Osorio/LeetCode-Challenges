## 👋 Introduction
Welcome to my repository of algorithm solutions! 

Here, I document my journey mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms** through LeetCode. My goal isn't just to "solve" the problems, but to find the most efficient solution in terms of **Time** and **Space** complexity.

Each solution includes:
- ✅ The full C++ implementation.
- 📊 Time & Space complexity analysis (Big-O).
- 📝 Comments explaining the logic and edge cases.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Methodology
- **Language:** C++ (STL)
- **Focus:** Clean code, readability, and optimization (moving from Brute Force to Optimal).
- **Tools:** Standard Template Library (`unordered_map`, `vector`, etc.).

## 📂 Repository Structure
I organize my solutions by **Algorithmic Pattern** rather than difficulty. I believe recognizing patterns is key to solving unseen problems.
